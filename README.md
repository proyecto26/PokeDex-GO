Hello! I'm the Professor Oak, I am creating this app so you can start your Pokémon adventures, and nothing better to be part of a community of Pokémon trainers.

I want you to help me grow the community and have incredible adventures together!
Now is your chance to talk to other nearby trainers from each team, create events to lead the greatest battles, share your experiences with other players and make friends wherever you go.

Feel free to send your comments and/or suggestions to: jdnichollsc@hotmail.com
